## Explore Datasets 🤯 
The dateset for this project is the Wine quality dataset from the University of Californina-Irvine 
https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo.git

🍷 The Wine Quality Dataset, hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is widely recognized and utilized for educational and research endeavors within the data science community, especially for tasks related to regression and classification analyses. What makes this dataset compelling is its blend of real-world data with the intriguing challenge of forecasting a subjective result—the quality of wine—through the lens of objective metrics.

🍷This dataset holds significant value for both students and practitioners eager to hone their skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and deploying diverse machine learning models. It presents a real-world case with a subjective outcome, offering a captivating challenge in leveraging objective data to forecast subjective attributes.

## Requirements 📋

### ⛰️ 1. Environment Setup (this is from an AI prompt for the project author to follow. The prompt began with notes taken from the course and consolidated within a GPT. Once complete it was edited for user-understanding)
#### Step 1: Choose Workflow Start Point

##### Option 1: Starting with GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub for the project's online presence, sharing, and publishing.
2. Clone the repository to a local machine, typically into a directory like Documents, to automatically set up a connection between the local project and GitHub.

##### Option 2: Starting on Local Machine
1. Create a new project folder within a chosen directory, such as Documents, on the local machine.
2. Initialize this folder with Git, add a remote pointing to a new or existing GitHub repository, and push the initial commit. This method allows more flexibility in setting up the project before publishing it online.

#### Step 2: Managing Changes with Git
- **Add Changes**: Stage changed files or all files in the directory for the next commit.
- **Commit Changes**: Save a snapshot of staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **Push Changes**: Upload committed changes to GitHub.
- **Pull Changes**: Sync the local repository with changes from GitHub to keep everything up-to-date.

#### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment
- **Create a Virtual Environment**: Establish a separate environment for the project to manage dependencies without affecting the global Python setup.
- **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the environment for installing project-specific packages.
- **Install Project Dependencies**: Use `pip` to install necessary packages for the project.
- **Freeze Dependencies**: Generate a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies and their versions.

#### Step 4: Ignore Unnecessary Files with .gitignore
- **Create a `.gitignore` File**: This file instructs Git on which files or directories to ignore in the project, such as the virtual environment folder and editor settings, crucial for keeping the repository clean and avoiding unnecessary file tracking.

#### Step 5: Use Logging for Output
- Incorporate logging into the project to save output to files for easier monitoring and debugging over time, instead of relying solely on `print()` statements.

#### Additional Tips
- **Commit Often**: Regular, small commits are key to effective version control, facilitating easier change tracking and reversion to previous states if necessary.
- **Use Branches**: For developing new features or experimenting, branches offer a safe space without affecting the main project.
- **Review Changes Before Committing**: Always review changes carefully before committing to ensure only intended changes are included.

This workflow provides a foundation for project management, combining best practices in version control, environment management, and project organization. Adapt as necessary to meet specific project needs.
